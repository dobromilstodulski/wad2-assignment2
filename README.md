## API Design
Give an overview of your web API design, perhaps similar to the following: 

|  |  GET | POST | PUT | DELETE
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
| /api/movies | Gets a list of movies | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/movies/{movieid} | Get a Movie | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/movies/{movieid}/reviews | Get all reviews for movie | Create a new review for Movie | N/A | N/A  
| /api/upcoming | Gets a list of upcoming movies | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/upcoming/{movieid} | Gets an upcoming movie | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/toprated | Gets a list of top rated movies | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/toprated/{movieid} | Gets a top rated movie | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/users | Get an user | Register an user / login | Update an user | N/A
| /api/users/{userid}/favourites | Gets the users favourite movies | Adds a movie to the favourite list | N/A | N/A
| /api/genres | Gets the genre list | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/search/{query} | Gets the movies related to a search query | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/moviedetails/{movieid} | Gets the details of a movie | N/A | N/A | N/A
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ...


## Security and Authentication
Implemented login with JWT and Passport. 

In the api the following are protected by authorization: 
+ /api/movies
+ /api/upcoming
+ /api/toprated

In the react app, I have integrated a login and register system with JWT. Once the user is logged in then more pages are added to the navbar such as the user's favourites and watch later movies. The profile page is not implemented as there inconsistencies where if one refreshes the page then the session is lost and the user has to log in again. There is a login page and a register page. And the following are protected by a private route:
+ /movies/favourites
+ /movies/watchlist

## Integrating with React App

For getting the main page or the movies page:

~~~Javascript
export const getMovies = () => {
  return fetch(
     '/api/movies',{headers: {
       'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
    }
  }
  )
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => {return json.results;});
};

~~~

For getting the upcoming movies page:

~~~Javascript
export const getUpcomingMovies = () => {
    return fetch(
       '/api/upcoming',{headers: {
         'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
      }
    }
    ).then(res => res.json());
  };

~~~

For getting the top rated movies page:

~~~Javascript
export const getTopRatedMovies = () => {
    return fetch(
       '/api/toprated',{headers: {
         'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
      }
    }
    ).then(res => res.json());
  };

~~~

For signing in and registering (authentication):

~~~JavaScript
export const login = (username, password) => {
    return fetch('/api/users', {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        method: 'post',
        body: JSON.stringify({ username: username, password: password })
    }).then(res => res.json())
};

export const signup = (username, password) => {
    return fetch('/api/users?action=register', {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        method: 'post',
        body: JSON.stringify({ username: username, password: password })
    }).then(res => res.json())
};

~~~

Here is a list that I tried to integrate but ran into trouble:

Genres (Works in the developer console but iterable error):

~~~Javascript
export const getGenres= () => {
  return fetch(
     '/api/genres',{headers: {
      'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
   }
 }
  )
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => json.results);
};
~~~

Movie Details (Also works in the developer console but doesn't display the content):

~~~Javascript
export const getMovieDetails= id => {

  return fetch(
    `/api/moviedetails/${id}`,{headers: {
      'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
   }
 }
  )
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => json.results);
};

~~~

Favourites:

~~~Javascript 
export const addFavourites = (movieId) => {
  return fetch('/api/:userName/favourites', {
      headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      method: 'post',
      body: JSON.stringify({ movieId: movieId })
  }).then(res => res.json())
};

export const getFavourites = () => {
  return fetch(
     '/api/:userName/favourites',{headers: {
       'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
    }
  }
  ).then(res => res.json());
};

~~~

Search (didn't know how to pass the query from the react app input box back into the API but it works on the API end):

~~~JavaScript
  export const search = (searchString) => {
    return fetch('/api/search?query=${searchString}', {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        method: 'post',
        body: JSON.stringify({ searchString: searchString })
    }).then(res => res.json())
};

~~~

Movie Reviews (Since login is inconsistent and this is protected then reviews may not show up, in fact without the movie details page, this will not show up.)
~~~JavaScript
export const getMovieReviews= id => {

  return fetch(
    `/api/movies/${id}/reviews`,{headers: {
         'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
      }
    }
  )
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => json.results);
};

~~~


## Extra features

Tried to integrate fs write file and read file to save the json results onto a file on the local machine and then export the data onto the MongoDB. When entering a new query, the file would then be overwrited with the new file and the search results will be seen where the search page is on the website.
